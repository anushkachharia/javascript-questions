let is used for variable declaration in javascript and let is block scoped.
eg: let x = 5;


this refers to the object it belongs to.

eg: 
var x = {
    y: 1,
    getValue: function() {
        return this;
    }
}

x.getValue() // this will refer to x object here

function getValue() {
    return this;
}

getValue(); // this will refer to window object here
